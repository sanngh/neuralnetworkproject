> Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote..

## General Information
- In this project, we are trying to build a models to predicts different guesture performed by user in front of TV, 
- We are using COnv 3D Which will predict 5 different gestures (are given below)
- Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
- Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
- Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
- Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
- Stop: Pause the movie

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 Best accuracy [ categorical_accuracy .99 &  val_categorical_accuracy 1] with batch size 32 / Epochs 30 / 20 frames 
- Conclusion 2
